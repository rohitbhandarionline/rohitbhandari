                Rohit Bhandari is a data-driven storyteller and AI strategist known for translating the most complex
                ideas in artificial intelligence, data, and automation into practical, powerful tools for everyday
                people.

                He’s spent the past 6+ years building real-world data solutions—from optimizing supply chains for
                enterprises to upskilling thousands of aspiring data professionals through YouTube, live coding streams,
                and online content. With a mission to make AI more human and accessible, Rohit brings together technical
                depth, business clarity, and inspirational storytelling.

                From working as a full-stack developer to becoming a data engineer and now an educator, his career arc
                reflects the kind of transformation he helps others achieve: breaking past career plateaus, making
                smarter choices, and thriving in an AI-first world.

                Growing online presence, Rohit has empowered
                working professionals, students, and solopreneurs to leverage tools like ChatGPT, Python, SQL, and Azure
                without overwhelm. His work blends human psychology, business efficiency, and tech strategy—making him a
                relatable guide for anyone navigating the future of work.
